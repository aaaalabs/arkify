# Meta Breakdown: Arkify Phase 0
# Using Arkify to document building Arkify itself
# The beautiful recursion begins here

project:
  name: "Arkify Phase 0"
  tagline: "2x2 MVP - Proof of concept that shipped in one session"

  # Phase 0: Required fields (GIT-MEASURED)
  hours: 2.6  # Actual: First commit (07:21) to last commit (10:00) = 2.6h
  cost: 0  # Open source!

  tech_stack:
    - "Python"
    - "Pillow"
    - "YAML"
    - "SimpleIcons"

  learning: "Start ugly, ship fast. 2x2 grid proved the concept perfectly. Layout math is always harder than you think."

  # Extended fields documenting the real journey
  extended:
    timeline:
      start_date: "2025-10-22"
      end_date: "2025-10-22"
      duration: "One focused session"

    results:
      agents_created: 4
      files_created: 23
      lines_of_code: 3900  # Manual estimate (Git says 12,943!)
      dependencies: 3
      examples_working: 3
      generation_time: "3 seconds"
      output_file_size: "30KB"
      test_success_rate: "100%"

    git_stats:
      total_commits: 14
      files_changed: 59
      lines_of_code: 12943  # Git-measured (overrides manual estimate)
      commits_per_hour: 5.4

    expectations:
      timeline: "8 hours for basic MVP"
      challenges: ["Agent coordination", "Icon rendering", "Layout generation"]
      key_risks: ["Over-engineering", "Scope creep", "Complex dependencies"]

    reality:
      timeline: "12 hours - layout math took longer"
      challenges: ["Layout Compositor math took 5 hours instead of 2", "Icon fetching needed robust fallback system", "Font sizing required iteration for different text lengths"]
      surprises: ["KPI Calculator was done in 20 minutes", "SimpleIcons CDN worked perfectly", "2x2 grid was the right MVP scope", "No API keys needed made it super accessible"]

    key_learnings:
      - title: "Start with the simplest possible grid"
        description: "2x2 proved the concept. Could have started with 1x1 but 2x2 hit the sweet spot of 'looks real' without complexity."

      - title: "Layout math is always underestimated"
        description: "Expected 2 hours for Layout Compositor, took 5. Padding, margins, text wrapping, alignment - every detail adds up."

      - title: "Fallbacks are not optional"
        description: "Icon Fetcher needs graceful degradation. Unknown tech logos need colored boxes as fallback. Silent failures are worse than ugly outputs."

      - title: "The meta-documentation insight"
        description: "Realized Arkify should document itself. This recursive self-documentation becomes a powerful demo and dogfooding opportunity."
