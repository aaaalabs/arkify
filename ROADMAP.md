# Arkify Roadmap - From MVP to World-Class

**Domain:** [arkify.app](https://arkify.app)
**Philosophy:** Simple, Lovable, Complete at every phase

---

## Overview

Arkify is a multi-agent AI system that automatically generates high-quality, visually appealing project breakdown infographics. This roadmap outlines the journey from ultra-minimal MVP to sophisticated, AI-powered content generation system.

### Core Principle
**Each phase delivers standalone value.** If we stop after any phase, we still have a usable, lovable product.

---

## PHASE 0: Ultra-Minimal MVP ⚡
**Timeline:** Week 1
**Goal:** Proof of concept - Can we generate ANYTHING worth sharing?

### Architecture
- **4 Essential Agents:** Mini Orchestrator, KPI Calculator, Icon Fetcher, Layout Compositor
- **Output:** 800x800px static PNG in 2x2 grid layout
- **Input:** Minimal 5-field YAML (name, hours, cost, tech_stack, learning)

### Deliverables
```
┌────────────┬────────────┐
│ Project    │ Tech Stack │
│ Title +    │ (4 logos)  │
│ 3 Stats    │            │
├────────────┼────────────┤
│ Time/Cost  │ One Key    │
│ Bar Chart  │ Learning   │
└────────────┴────────────┘
```

- Working Python script
- 3 example YAML files
- Basic README
- Generation time: <30 seconds

### Success Criteria
✅ One person shares the output on social media
✅ Output looks professional (not amateur)
✅ Installation works in one command

### Why It's Lovable
**It WORKS.** Input your project, get a shareable image in 30 seconds. Better than manually designing in Canva.

### Open Source Setup
- MIT License
- GitHub repository structure
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- "Good first issues" labeled

---

## PHASE 1: Enhanced Story 📖
**Timeline:** Weeks 2-3
**Goal:** Add narrative depth - tell a story, not just show facts

### New Agents
5. **Story Arc Designer** - Narrative flow optimization
6. **Graph Generator** - Comparison charts (expected vs actual)

### Upgrade: 3x3 Grid (900x1200px)
```
┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
│ Header    │ Header    │ Header    │
│ (spanning 3 columns)  │           │
├───────────┼───────────┼───────────┤
│ Results   │ Tech      │ Architect.│
│ (metrics) │ Stack     │ (basic)   │
├───────────┼───────────┼───────────┤
│ Expected  │ Reality   │ Learning  │
│ vs Actual │ Check     │ + CTA     │
└───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
```

### New Features
- Template variations (2-3 different layouts)
- "Expectations vs Reality" panel for relatability
- Story arc creates curiosity (shows progression)

### Success Criteria
✅ Save rate >15% (LinkedIn metric)
✅ Template contribution from community
✅ First external PR merged

### Why It's Lovable
**Now it tells YOUR story.** The "expectations vs reality" creates relatability and shareability.

---

## PHASE 2: Visual Intelligence 🎨
**Timeline:** Weeks 4-5
**Goal:** Add technical depth with auto-generated architecture diagrams

### New Agents
7. **Diagram Generator** - Mermaid.js → SVG architecture diagrams

### Upgrade: Rich Visualizations
- Auto-generate system architecture from tech stack
- Data flow diagrams (User → Frontend → API → DB)
- Support for LinkedIn 4:5 ratio (1080x1350px)
- Multiple export formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)

### New Features
- Color theme system (5 built-in palettes)
- Custom branding (logo/watermark support)
- Component export (individual SVG panels)

### Success Criteria
✅ Diagrams are portfolio-quality
✅ Used in professional case studies
✅ 3+ community color palettes contributed

### Why It's Lovable
**The auto-generated architecture diagram alone is worth it.** People spend hours making these in Excalidraw/Miro.

---

## PHASE 3: Motion Magic ✨
**Timeline:** Weeks 6-7
**Goal:** Add animation - make it scroll-stopping on social media

### New Agents
8. **Animation Designer** - GSAP/Lottie animation choreography

### Upgrade: Animated GIF Output

- Static fallback for accessibility (`prefers-reduced-motion`)

### Success Criteria
✅ 2x save rate vs static version (A/B tested)
✅ "Scroll stop" metric >40%
✅ Professional motion (not amateur)

### Why It's Lovable
**NOW it's LinkedIn-ready.** Animated posts get 3x more engagement. This makes people look like pros.

- Auto-fetch logos and brand colors
- Generate insights from patterns ("Debugging took 27% of time - 2x typical")
- Suggest contrarian takes ("Everyone says X, you found Y")

### Reduced Input Requirements
```yaml
project:
  name: "AI Todo App"
  tech_stack: ["Cursor", "Claude", "Next.js"]  # Rest auto-fetched
  hours: {setup: 3, coding: 12, debug: 8}      # AI suggests insights
  # System fills in the rest via research
```

### Success Criteria
✅ 50% less manual input required
✅ Generated insights are surprising
✅ Research data 95%+ accurate (verified)
