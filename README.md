# Arkify

**Universal multi-layer storytelling system**

Arkify transforms complex narratives into beautiful visual breakdowns. From tech projects to life stories, business ventures to creative journeys - Arkify reveals the layers of any story worth telling.

**Domain:** [arkify.app](https://arkify.app)

---

## 🌍 Beyond Code: Stories on Many Levels

While Arkify starts with **technical project documentation** (Phase 0-3), the vision is universal storytelling:

- **💻 Tech Projects** - Software development journeys, codebase evolution
- **👤 Life Stories** - Personal evolution, career pivots, biographical arcs
- **🚀 Business Ventures** - Startup journeys, entrepreneurial pivots, company growth
- **🎨 Creative Projects** - Album creation, book writing, artistic evolution
- **🌀 Multi-Layer Narratives** - Stories that exist on multiple dimensions simultaneously

**Current Focus:** Tech projects (indie hacker use case)
**Future Vision:** Universal storytelling platform for any narrative with depth

> "Every story worth telling has multiple layers. Arkify reveals them all."

## ✨ What is this?

You built something cool. You want to share it on LinkedIn, Twitter, your blog. But creating a professional-looking project breakdown takes 3-4 hours in Figma or Canva.

**Arkify does it in 30 seconds.**

```bash
python arkify.py examples/ai-todo-app.yaml
# ✅ Output: output/ai-todo-app.png (ready to post!)
```

## 🎯 Phase 0: Ultra-Minimal MVP

**Status:** MVP - Working but basic
**Output:** 800x800px static PNG in 2x2 grid layout

Current features:
- ✅ 4-panel grid layout (Header, Tech Stack, Metrics, Learning)
- ✅ Auto-fetch tech logos from SimpleIcons CDN
- ✅ Professional purple gradient design
- ✅ Generate in <30 seconds
- ✅ Zero API keys required

Coming soon (see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)):
- 📖 Phase 1: Better storytelling (3x3 grid, narrative flow)
- 🎨 Phase 2: Architecture diagrams
- ✨ Phase 3: Animated GIFs
- 🧠 Phase 4: AI-powered insights

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🏗️ Architecture (Phase 0)

```
arkify.py (CLI entry point)
    ↓
agents/orchestrator.py (coordinates everything)
    ↓
├─→ agents/kpi_calculator.py (metrics math)
├─→ agents/icon_fetcher.py (fetch logos)
└─→ agents/layout_compositor.py (generate PNG)
```

Each agent is independent and can be improved separately.
