# Multi-Domain Vision: Universal Storytelling

**Status:** Future Vision (Phase 7+ Implementation)
**Current Focus:** Tech Projects (Phase 0-6)

---

## Philosophy: Stories on Many Levels

> "Every story worth telling has multiple layers. Arkify reveals them all."

### The Core Insight

A project is never just a project. It's simultaneously:
- A **technical journey** (tools, architecture, implementation)
- A **personal story** (growth, challenges, transformation)
- A **business venture** (metrics, customers, pivots)
- A **creative process** (design, iteration, artistic choices)

Traditional storytelling forces you to pick ONE angle. Arkify will eventually let you tell ALL angles.

## Multi-Layer Narratives (Phase 8+)

### The Ultimate Vision

A story can simultaneously exist in multiple domains. Arkify Phase 8+ will visualize all layers.

### Example: "Building VoiceLoop MVP"

#### Layer 1: Tech Project
- **Problem:** Process documentation sucks
- **Solution:** Voice-first AI + BPMN generation
- **Reality:** 200 hours, React + AI integration challenges
- **Wisdom:** Voice UX is the future of business software
- **Action:** Open source, looking for early adopters

#### Layer 2: Life Story
- **Struggle:** Burned out from corporate tech job
- **Breakthrough:** Realized I love building, not managing
- **Integration:** Quit job, went indie hacker full-time
- **Wisdom:** Freedom > Security when you have runway
- **Legacy:** Inspiring others to take the leap

#### Layer 3: Business Venture
- **Vision:** Voice-first process digitalization for SMEs
- **Validation:** 3 paying customers in first month
- **Execution:** MVP built in 6 weeks
- **Pivot:** From B2C to B2B based on feedback
- **Scale:** Targeting 10 customers by Q1

#### Layer 4: Creative Project
- **Inspiration:** Watched people struggle with forms
- **Creation:** Designed voice UX patterns
- **Struggle:** Making AI feel human and reliable
- **Refinement:** 7 iterations on the conversation flow
- **Release:** Product launch on ProductHunt

### Visual Representation

**Option A: Multi-Panel Layout**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│         VoiceLoop Journey            │
├──────────┬──────────┬────────────────┤
│   💻     │    👤    │      🚀        │
│  Tech    │   Life   │   Business     │
│  Layer   │  Layer   │    Layer       │
├──────────┴──────────┴────────────────┤
│             🎨 Creative Layer         │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Option B: Layered Depth**
```
         [Creative Process]
              ↓
         [Business Metrics]
              ↓
         [Life Transition]
              ↓
         [Tech Implementation]
```

**Option C: Parallel Timelines**
```
Tech:     Problem ━━━━━━━━ Solution ━━━━━━━━ Reality
Life:     Struggle ━━━━━━━ Breakthrough ━━━━━ Integration
Business: Vision ━━━━━━━━━ Validation ━━━━━━━ Execution
Creative: Inspiration ━━━━ Creation ━━━━━━━━ Refinement
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0-6: Tech Domain Perfection (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** Make tech project breakdowns world-class

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ 2x2 static grid (Phase 0)
- ✅ 3x3 story arc (Phase 1)
- ✅ Architecture diagrams (Phase 2)
- ✅ Animated GIFs (Phase 3)
- ✅ AI enrichment (Phase 4)
- ✅ Quality templates (Phase 5)
- ✅ Multi-platform outputs (Phase 6)

**Why First:** Perfect one domain before expanding. Build extensible architecture.

---

### Phase 7: Multi-Domain Foundation (Month 4)

**Goal:** Refactor core for universal storytelling

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Before (Phase 0-6): Tech-specific
class ProjectBreakdownGenerator:
    def generate(self, tech_project: TechProject) -> PNG

# After (Phase 7+): Domain-agnostic
class UniversalStoryBreakdownGenerator:
    def generate(self, story: Story, domain: Domain) -> PNG
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Core refactor for domain-agnostic design
- [ ] Schema extension system
- [ ] Domain-specific story arc engine
- [ ] **Life Stories domain** (first non-tech)
- [ ] CLI: `python arkify.py --domain life story.yaml`

**Success Criteria:**
- Tech domain still works (backward compatible)
- First life story breakdown generated
- Schema extension documented
- 3+ story arc templates

---

### Phase 8: Universal Storytelling (Months 5-6)

**Goal:** Complete multi-domain support

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] **Business Ventures domain**
- [ ] **Creative Projects domain**
- [ ] Multi-layer narrative support
- [ ] Cross-domain insights engine
- [ ] Domain-specific visual styles

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Single domain
python arkify.py --domain tech project.yaml
python arkify.py --domain life story.yaml

# Multi-layer (Phase 8.5)
python arkify.py --multi-layer voiceloop.yaml
# Generates 4 breakdowns (tech, life, business, creative)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- 4 domains operational
- Domain-specific visuals
- Multi-layer examples
- 100+ non-tech breakdowns

---

## Technical Architecture

### Core Schema System

```python
from typing import Protocol

class DomainExtension(Protocol):
    """Base protocol for domain-specific extensions."""

    def validate(self, data: dict) -> bool:
        """Validate domain-specific data."""
        ...

    def enrich(self, data: dict) -> dict:
        """Enrich with domain-specific insights."""
        ...

class StoryArc(Protocol):
    """Base protocol for story arc templates."""

    stages: list[str]  # e.g., ["Problem", "Solution", ...]

    def map_data_to_stages(self, data: dict) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Map input data to story stages."""
        ...

# Domain Implementations
class TechDomainExtension(DomainExtension):
    def validate(self, data: dict) -> bool:
        required = ['tech_stack', 'hours', 'cost']
        return all(k in data for k in required)

class LifeDomainExtension(DomainExtension):
    def validate(self, data: dict) -> bool:
        required = ['life_phases', 'turning_points']
        return all(k in data for k in required)

# Story Arc Implementations
class TechStoryArc(StoryArc):
    stages = ["Problem", "Solution", "Reality", "Wisdom", "Action"]

class LifeStoryArc(StoryArc):
    stages = ["Struggle", "Breakthrough", "Integration", "Wisdom", "Legacy"]
```

### Domain Registry

```python
# domains/registry.py
DOMAINS = {
    'tech': {
        'extension': TechDomainExtension(),
        'story_arc': TechStoryArc(),
        'visual_style': TechVisualStyle(),
    },
    'life': {
        'extension': LifeDomainExtension(),
        'story_arc': LifeStoryArc(),
        'visual_style': LifeVisualStyle(),
    },
    'business': {
        'extension': BusinessDomainExtension(),
        'story_arc': BusinessStoryArc(),
        'visual_style': BusinessVisualStyle(),
    },
    'creative': {
        'extension': CreativeDomainExtension(),
        'story_arc': CreativeStoryArc(),
        'visual_style': CreativeVisualStyle(),
    },
}
```

### Accessibility

All domains must meet:
- WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios
- Screen reader friendly
- Keyboard navigation
- Responsive design

---

## Community & Contribution

### Domain Template Submissions

Phase 8+ will accept community-contributed domain templates:

```yaml
# domains/my-custom-domain.yaml
domain:
  name: "travel"
  story_arc: ["Dream", "Plan", "Journey", "Experience", "Reflection"]

  required_fields:
    - destinations
    - travel_dates
    - budget

  visual_style:
    colors: ["#FF6B6B", "#4ECDC4", "#FFE66D"]
    icons: "travel-themed"
    layout: "map-focused"
```

### Use Cases We Haven't Thought Of

The beauty of extensible architecture: **communities will create domains we never imagined.**

Potential future domains:
- 🎓 Education (learning journeys, courses)
- 🏃 Fitness (transformation stories)
- 🌱 Environment (sustainability projects)
- 🎮 Gaming (game dev, speedruns)
- 📚 Research (academic papers, discoveries)
- 🎭 Events (conference, meetup stories)
