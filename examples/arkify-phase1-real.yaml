  tech_stack:
    - "Python"
    - "PIL/Pillow"
    - "Claude Code"
    - "Git"
  learning: "Iteration beats perfection. 5 Apple-quality iterations (overflows → contrast → density → alignment → simplicity) transformed output from barely readable to pixel-perfect. Each iteration 2x better."

  expectations:
    timeline: "2-3 hours for basic layout"
    features:
      - "Simple 2x2 grid"
      - "Basic text rendering"
      - "Hardcoded colors"

  reality:
    timeline: "8 hours with 5 quality iterations"
    features_delivered:
      - "3x3 responsive grid (900x1200px LinkedIn optimized)"
      - "8px grid precision alignment"
      - "WCAG 2.1 AA contrast (7.12:1)"
      - "SVG icon rendering with cairosvg"
      - "Future Dust 2025 design system"
      - "Zero mock data policy"
    challenges:
      - "Jony Ive critique revealed poor readability (fonts too small, contrast 2:1)"
      - "Text overflows and overlaps in dynamic content"
      - "Random spacing breaking visual rhythm"
      - "SVG rendering required cairosvg library"
    surprises:
      - "5 Apple iterations methodology worked perfectly"
      - "User prioritized value-density over breathing room"
      - "8px grid alignment feels magical"
      - "No mock data policy strengthens authenticity"
